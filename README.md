# moodTracker
I wanted to create a project that let me track my mood for the day and it would give spit out a numerical average after a week, month, etc to see how I have been feeling lately.
The project is written in vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML. I might convert it to React eventually. And for now there is no back end, but I was thinking of using MongoDB.
